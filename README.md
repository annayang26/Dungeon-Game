# ðŸ‘¹ Escape the Dungeon ðŸ‘¹ 
<sub> This is a game that I made for CS151. </sub>
### The player can pick an avatar out of four options. Then, the player will enter a dungeon, with different enemies randomly spawn on the map. The player can pick up weapons and attack the enemies when the player gets close enough. There are objects that the player can grab and increase the health points (HP). When the player defeats all the enemies, a flag will appear to present where the exit of the dungeon is. When the player reaches the flag, a victory message will show up on the screen. However, if the player's HP drops below 0, a game over message will appear.
